# Uber Fares Dataset Analysis using Power BI

## Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Uber ride fares dataset, focusing on understanding fare patterns, ride durations, and key operational metrics that drive the ride-sharing economy. As part of the Introduction to Big Data Analytics course (INSY 8413), this analysis aims to extract actionable insights from real-world transportation data to support data-driven decision-making in the mobility sector.

### Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis include:

- **Fare Pattern Analysis**: Investigate fare distribution patterns across different time periods, locations, and ride characteristics
- **Temporal Trend Identification**: Analyze hourly, daily, and seasonal variations in ride demand and pricing
- **Operational Insights**: Identify peak hours, busiest periods, and demand fluctuations to optimize resource allocation
- **Business Intelligence**: Develop interactive visualizations and dashboards to support strategic business decisions
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden patterns and correlations

### Project Scope

This analysis encompasses the complete data analytics pipeline from raw data acquisition to final dashboard creation. The project leverages industry-standard tools including Python for data preprocessing, statistical analysis for pattern recognition, and Power BI for interactive visualization and business intelligence reporting.

The dataset analysis covers multiple dimensions including temporal patterns, geographical distributions, fare structures, and ride characteristics, providing a holistic view of the Uber transportation ecosystem.
